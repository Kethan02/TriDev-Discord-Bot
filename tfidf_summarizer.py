# Louis Daniel Armstrong (August 4, 1901 â€“ July 6, 1971), nicknamed "Satchmo",[a] "Satch",
# and "Pops",[2] was an American trumpeter, composer, vocalist, and actor who was among the most influential
# figures in jazz. His career spanned five decades, from the 1920s to the 1960s, and different eras in the
# history of jazz.[3] In 2017, he was inducted into the Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame. Armstrong was born and raised in New Orleans.
# Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an inventive trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz,
# shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance.[4] Around 1922, he followed his mentor,
# Joe "King" Oliver, to Chicago to play in the Creole Jazz Band. In Chicago, he spent time with other popular jazz musicians,
# reconnecting with his friend Bix Beiderbecke and spending time with Hoagy Carmichael and Lil Hardin. He earned a reputation
# at "cutting contests", and relocated to New York in order to join Fletcher Henderson's band. With his instantly recognizable rich,
# gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer and skillful improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song.
# He was also skilled at scat singing. Armstrong is renowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice as well as his trumpet
# playing. By the end of Armstrong's career in the 1960s, his influence had spread to popular music in general. Armstrong was one
# of the first popular African-American entertainers to "cross over" to wide popularity with white (and international) audiences.
# He rarely publicly politicized his race, to the dismay of fellow African Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for
# desegregation in the Little Rock crisis. He was able to access the upper echelons of American society at a time when this
# was difficult for black men.

# Alright, I want to check out kubuntu, what is the best method? I have 4.10 ubuntu on a cd, should I install that and just grab the KDE files or download the install CD for Kubuntu?
# http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/hoary/preview/
# if you install Ubuntu 4.10, you will need to upgrade to the development release anyway in order to install the Kubuntu desktop
# so it is probably simpler to download a new ISO
# Thanks mdz, will do
# http://www.kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=22008
# i will post a amd64 and ix86 iso in about 10 hours
# SuperL4g what you at now?
# 20%
# 21% here :(
# did you receive the URL I sent you, where the .torrents are available?
# they are in the same directory as the isos; we always publish torrents at the same time
# torrents did not work
# if they did not work for you, the problem is on your end (I am using them right now)
# mdz: yes sir, and unfortunately, no one wants or is going after the PPC .iso at the moment :)
# Torrents are working for me
# i have access to two fast servers
# brb
# http and ftp will work for everyone
# yes, but they will also take 10 hours
# bittorrent not only saves bandwidth on the server side, it'll get you the file faster
# mdz not at 200+ and 300+ k
# did ne one like my ss?
# 16.9k is no good
# i have tons of bandwith to use
# Give me some...I have low bandwidth.. :(
# lol
# ;-)
# 25k is pegging me LMAO
# yeah, no one wants the PPC one like I do, at this point :)
# I'm seeding it, zero peers
# you have it already?
# I built it :)
# can site that host kubuntu isos use the kubuntu logo?
# Good way to get it ;-)
# I have a seed running with all 6 images; currently ~75kb/sec on -live-powerpc.iso, 0kb on -install-powerpc.iso
# i think i will also offer a isos in parts
# I don't see why not, as long as you are offering the official images
# I wonder why I can't see it...?
# mdz i want to be shure
# we do not want issues later
# I suppose I could be hitting the limit on the number of peers
# hmm, no, that limit is per torrent
# every other torrent is active, and I've served 3.6GB worth of the powerpc install iso previously, so I think it's OK on this end
# i do not see a point of contact on the site
# i will just not use the logo :(
# that's fine too
# we don't use the logo on the official download page either
# i want to i just do not want to get hit later
# I've told you that it's fine, but I don't think it's important
